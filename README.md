                                            A simple project to recode the Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs project of Cousera with Pytorch.
    Because the tensors of dataloader of pytorch are with the shape(1,28,28), I desided to refer the pytouch code's materials more than change code for tensorflew to pytorch to avoid mistakes. However, it turns out hards to recode the tensorflow codes of generator and discriminator into pytorch codes without mistakes or bad performance. Therefore, I decide to leave them as basically the codes of generator and discriminator codes from pytorch sample code for now.
    I commited the original tensorflow codes for reference.
